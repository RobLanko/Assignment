            <p>Well let's see, my educational background is very diverse. I went through some awesome courses for avionics and was able to get certifications for various amounts of heavy equipment. That was just based on my military career.</p>
            <p>After I was honorably discharged, i was lucky enough to enroll in college at the University of North Carolina for Aerospace Engineering. I am currently half way through to getting my bachelors and would love to use my knowledge in that field and try to combine it with coding. </p>
            <p>I started to hear about coding more and more, as many of my friends use it as a source of income, I thought "why not?". I started my research and a few month later it wound me up at SDGKU!</p>
